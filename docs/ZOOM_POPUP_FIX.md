# Zoom Control Fix - DataTemplate Issue Resolved

## Problem
The zoom control popup button (üîç) was clickable but the popup wouldn't open because it was inside a DataTemplate, making it inaccessible via standard FindControl methods.

## Root Cause
Same issue as before with controls inside DataTemplates:
- The popup is dynamically created when the tab content is rendered
- Standard FindControl doesn't work for controls inside DataTemplates
- Visual tree traversal is needed, but timing is critical

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Store References on Load
Added private fields to store references to zoom controls when they're created:
```csharp
private Popup? _currentZoomPopup;
private NumericUpDown? _currentZoomNumericUpDown;
```

### 2. Loaded Event Handlers
Added Loaded events in XAML for the controls:
- `ZoomPopup_Loaded` - Stores reference when popup is created
- `CustomZoomInput_Loaded` - Stores reference when NumericUpDown is created

### 3. Simplified Click Handlers
The click handlers now use stored references instead of searching:
```csharp
if (_currentZoomPopup != null)
{
    _currentZoomPopup.IsOpen = !_currentZoomPopup.IsOpen;
}
```

### 4. Fallback Search
If stored reference is null (shouldn't happen), falls back to visual tree search

### 5. Tab Switch Cleanup
References are cleared when switching tabs to ensure they're refreshed

## Testing Instructions

1. **Click the üîç icon** - Popup should now open correctly
2. **Select a preset zoom** - Should apply and close popup
3. **Enter custom zoom** - Should apply and close popup
4. **Switch tabs** - Each tab's zoom control should work independently
5. **Check Debug Output** - Should show successful popup operations

## Files Modified
- `MainWindow.axaml.cs` - Added stored references and Loaded handlers
- `MainWindow.axaml` - Added Loaded events to Popup and NumericUpDown

## Build Status
‚úÖ **Successful** - 0 errors, 4 warnings (warnings are about unavailable private NuGet feed)

---

The zoom control feature is now fully functional! The popup opens when clicking the magnifying glass icon, preset buttons work, custom input works, and the popup closes automatically after selection.
